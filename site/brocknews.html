<h2>Brock Lesnar Suspended and <br> 
Fined for UFC Drug Test Failures</br> </h2>
<p>Brock Lesnar has been suspended for one year for his two failed drug tests related to his UFC 200 win over Mark Hunt earlier this year, <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/12/15/13972106/brock-lesnar-suspended-for-one-year-fined-250000-for-failed-ufc-200" target="_blank">MMAFighting.com</a>. The punishment was handed down today by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Lesnar will be able to return to MMA in 2017.</p>
<p class="brock1"> Lesnar also agreed to pay a $250,000 fine as part of a settlement with the Nevada attorney general’s office. Lesnar’s win over Hunt will be overturned into a No Contest.
</p>
<p class="brock2"> As reported a few months back, Lesnar twice tested positive for anti-estrogenic agent Hydroxy-clomiphene in pre-UFC 200 fight drug tests. One test was on the day of the fight, July 9th, and the other was on June 28th. Lesnar received a then-UFC record $2.5 million purse for the victory.</p>

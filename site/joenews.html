<h2>Top WWE NXT Star Injured?</h2>
<p>It appears Samoa Joe may be suffering from some kind of injury. He appeared at Thursday's WWE NXT live event before the main event and announced that he was not cleared to compete. He then watched the main event from ringside as NXT Champion Shinsuke Nakamura and Tye Dillinger defeated Bobby Roode and Andrade"Cien" Almas.</p>
<p class="joe1"> Joe worked the steel cage match against Nakamura in Melbourne, Australia on December 8th and worked again on December 10th in Newcastle. The Newcastle main event saw Nakamura, Dillinger and Buddy Murphy defeat Joe, Roode and Elias Samson. It was noted by a correspondent that Joe and Nakamura didn't do much in the match. Joe then worked the December 12th NXT live event on the Gold Coast, which saw Nakamura and TM-61 defeat Joe and The Revival. A correspondent at that event noted that The Revival and TM-61 worked most of the match while Roode and Dillinger had some involvement but there was not a lot of action from Joe. </p>
<p class="joe2"> Joe's last match came on December 13th in Sydney.He teamed with Roode and Samson but lost to Nakamura, Murphy and Dillinger. Correspondents at that show noted that there was a lot of stalling and crowd work with minimal bumps and few high-impact spots. This main event also had some controversy with it as fans were upset that the advertised Fatal 4 Way main event of Nakamura vs. Joe vs. Roode vs. Dillinger was changed to the six-man. Fans booed as soon as the change was announced and there were reports of the match being hijacked by the crowd at times.</p>

<h2>AJ Styles Injury Update, <br> 
WWE Pulls Him from More Shows</br> </h2>
<p>It looks like James Ellsworth won't be getting his WWE Title shot this year. WWE has pulled WWE Champion AJ Styles from all live events this month. His next scheduled live event is December 26th from Madison Square Garden, a Triple Threat with Dean Ambrose and John Cena, who also returns to the company from filming FOX's American Grit that night.</p>
<p class="aj1"> AJ is expected to appear at SmackDown tapings until then but not wrestle. As noted earlier, Styles vs. new #1 contender Dolph Ziggler has been announced for the final SmackDown of 2016, from Chicago on December 27th.
</p>
<p class="aj2"> Styles has not wrestled since December 4th at WWE TLC after suffering a minor ankle injury while taking a backdrop to the floor from Ambrose. Styles was set to defend on last night's SmackDown against Ellsworth but the match did not happen.</p>
